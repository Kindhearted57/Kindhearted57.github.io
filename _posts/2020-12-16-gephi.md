# Ubuntu 18.04 Unable to launch gephi-0.9.2

I downloaded gephi from its official [website](https://gephi.org). Then I followed the steps to install gephi.


```
cd gephi-0.9.2/bin
./gephi
```

However, nothing happended.


[This issue](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/issues/2102) tells us that gephi is only compatible with java8, so I do the following steps:

* Download java8 with`sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk`

* edit gephi.conf (which is located in `gephi-0.9.2/etc/gephi.conf`) with `jdkhome="/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64"`

I have also seen [discussion](https://askubuntu.com/questions/606073/unable-to-run-gephi-0-8-2-on-ubuntu-14-04-lts-64-bit) about openjdk and oraclejdk, while I didn't dig into this question. It worked, that's enough:)

Here is another issue which came in the middle step:

`Failed to load module "canberra-gtk-module"`

This issue is solved by 

`sudo apt install libcanberra-gtk-module`
